Hey there, I'm LISA! üôÇ

In [my last post](/en/vibe-coding/ai-tools/2025/09/15/task-master-discovery.html), I talked about how I discovered Task Master. Today I'll share **how to actually use it** in detail!

The **PRD writing process** turned out to be more important than I thought. If you do this part carelessly, the quality of generated tasks suffers later.

## Step 1: Starting Systematic PRD Writing

When developing TipSmart, I took a **systematic approach**.

**I requested Claude like this:**
> "I want to create a PRD for service development. Please ask me necessary questions based on the sample PRD and write a PRD based on that."

And I **attached the example_prd.txt file**.

This way, instead of Claude asking random questions, it asked **systematically based on the sample format**!

## Step 2: Claude's Storm of Questions - This is Key!

Then Claude started throwing **really systematic questions** at me.

### **6 Categories of Questions I Received:**

#### **1. Overview Questions:**
- "What is the name and brief description of the service you want to develop?"
- "What is the main problem this service aims to solve?"
- "Who are the main target users?"
- "What is the value proposition that differentiates it from competing services?"

#### **2. Core Features Questions:**
- "What are the 3-5 core features of this service?"
- "How would you prioritize each feature? (high/medium/low)"
- "What is the main value these features provide to users?"

#### **3. User Experience Questions:**
- "How would you define the main user personas (2-3)?"
- "What is the most important user flow within the service?"
- "Are there any special considerations for UI/UX design?"

#### **4. Technical Architecture Questions:**
- "What technology stack is needed to implement the service?"
- "Are there any external APIs or services that need integration?"
- "What are the main components of the data model?"

#### **5. Development Roadmap Questions:**
- "What features must be included in the MVP?"
- "What are some future expandable features?"
- "How do you plan to divide the development phases?"

#### **6. Risk Factors and Response Questions:**
- "What are the main technical challenges expected during service development?"
- "What potential issues do you think could arise after service launch?"
- "What are your response strategies for these risk factors?"

### **Answers Determine PRD Quality**

**How thoroughly you answer** was really important here!

At first I answered casually like "Oh, just whatever..." but the resulting PRD was too vague.

**Actual Answer Examples from TipSmart Development:**

#### **1. Overview Answers:**
> **Service Name**: "TipSmart - Smart Tip Calculator"  
> **Problem Solved**: "Complex and time-consuming tip calculation and person splitting at restaurants"  
> **Target Users**: "20-40 year old office workers who need quick calculations after dining with colleagues"  
> **Differentiation**: "Calculation completed in 3 seconds, intuitive UI, consideration for Korean tipping culture"

#### **2. Core Feature Priorities:**
> **High**: Basic tip calculation, person splitting  
> **Medium**: Calculation history, settings features  
> **Low**: Widgets, Apple Watch integration  

#### **3. Tech Stack:**
> **Platform**: iOS 15+, SwiftUI  
> **Architecture**: MVVM pattern  
> **Data**: Core Data (local storage)  
> **Monetization**: AdMob + In-App Purchase

The more **specific and detailed** I answered, the better the quality of the resulting PRD and tasks became.

## Step 3: Multiple Revision Rounds

When the first PRD came out... **I wasn't satisfied**.

- Too generic and obvious content
- No specific implementation direction
- Missing technical constraints

So I **kept requesting revisions**:

> "Write user scenarios more specifically"
> "Specify tech stack and architecture"  
> "Set priorities for each feature too"

I revised it **about 3-4 times**. During this process, I discovered many parts I hadn't thought of.

## Step 4: Applying example_prd.txt Format

When satisfactory content emerged, I requested rewriting to match **the example_prd.txt format I initially attached**.

```
Now rewrite this to match the example_prd.txt format I attached initially. 
And keep the total length under 150 lines.
```

### **Why I Set the 150-Line Constraint**

This part is important:

‚úÖ **Task Master Processing Performance**: PRDs that are too long might not parse properly  
‚úÖ **API Cost Savings**: Increases Claude API token usage  
‚úÖ **Focus**: Containing only essentials creates clearer task generation  

I actually tried with a PRD over 200 lines initially and got strange tasks generated.

### **Actual Completed TipSmart PRD (Partial Disclosure)**

Here's part of the actual PRD that came out in example_prd.txt format:

```markdown
TipSmart - Product Requirements Document

Overview
TipSmart is a smart tip calculator for international travelers visiting the US. 
It helps users unfamiliar with local tipping culture calculate appropriate tips 
and learn regional etiquette. Target monthly revenue: $500+ for iOS app.

Core Features
1. Smart Tip Calculator
   Function: Amount input ‚Üí Tip% selection ‚Üí Total/tip display
   Value: Fast, accurate calculation prevents social mistakes
   Implementation: Pre/post-tax toggle, 15/18/20/25% buttons, rounding

2. Regional Tip Guide
   Function: 5 major cities √ó 4 service categories guide
   Value: Local customs learning builds confidence
   Implementation: NYC/LA/Chicago/SF/Miami, restaurant/taxi/hotel/bar

3. Simple Bill Split
   Function: Auto-calculate per-person amount with headcount input
   Value: Quick settlement for group dining
   Implementation: 2-10 people, equal split only
```

As you can see, each feature is clearly defined with **Function ‚Üí Value ‚Üí Implementation** structure. This is how it was **concisely organized with just the essentials**.

## Task Master Execution - Finally!

With the PRD ready, now it's time for **Task Master execution**.

### **MCP Setup**

Initially I was stuck just finding the config file, but it was surprisingly simple:

1. **Cursor Settings** ‚Üí Add MCP server
2. **Claude API Key** set in environment variables
3. **Restart** then activate Task Master

### **First Execution Tension**

The moment I input the 150-line PRD and **hit the "Generate tasks" button**!

"Will proper tasks actually come out?"

The waiting time felt really long. üòÖ

## Results - 10 Tasks Generated!

And the result... **I was really amazed**!

![Generated 10 Tasks](/assets/images/20250916_02/generated-tasks.png)

### **Generated Tasks (TipSmart)**

1. **Project Setup with MVVM Architecture** (high priority)
2. **Core Data Model Implementation** (high priority)  
3. **Tip Calculator UI and Logic** (high priority)
4. **Bill Split Functionality** (medium priority)
5. **History Tracking Implementation** (medium priority)
6. **Regional Tip Guide Content and UI** (medium priority)
7. **Accessibility Implementation** (high priority)
8. **UI Polish and iOS HIG Compliance** (high priority)
9. **AdMob Integration** (low priority)
10. **App Store Preparation and Submission** (medium priority)
11. **UX/UI Improvements for Calculator and History Features** (additionally generated)

### **Amazing Parts**

#### **1. Automatic Priority Assignment**
**high priority**: Core features (MVVM setup, calculation logic, accessibility)  
**medium priority**: Additional features (History, Regional Guide, app store)  
**low priority**: Monetization features (AdMob)

**It was exactly the same as actual development order!**

#### **2. Dependency Consideration**
Looking at the task table, it even showed which tasks each task depends on. For example, "Accessibility Implementation" was set to proceed after completing tasks 3, 4, 5, 6.

#### **3. Things I Almost Missed**
"Accessibility Implementation", "iOS HIG Compliance" - I didn't specify these in the PRD but it automatically created them as tasks.

#### **4. Tasks Added During Development**
The 11th task was additionally generated during development progress. Task Master can expand tasks according to situations.

## Development Start - Task Subdivision

When actually proceeding with each task, I divided them into **4-5 subtasks** again.

For example, the "AdMob Integration" task:
- Install and configure AdMob SDK
- Register App ID, Ad Unit ID  
- Compose banner ad UI
- Ad loading and display logic
- Error handling and fallback

I subdivided like this and requested them one by one to Claude Code.

## PRD Quality is Really Important

From experience, **how much you think during PRD writing stage** determines the entire project.

### **Effects of Well-Written PRD:**
‚úÖ Logical task sequence  
‚úÖ Includes features that might be missed  
‚úÖ Appropriate difficulty distribution  
‚úÖ Clear completion criteria  

### **Problems with Carelessly Written PRD:**
‚ùå Vague tasks  
‚ùå Missing important features  
‚ùå Random sequence  
‚ùå Ambiguous completion criteria  

**Answering Claude's questions thoroughly is really important!**
