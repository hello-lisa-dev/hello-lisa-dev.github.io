Hello, I'm LISA! üôÇ

Today I want to talk about **Vibe Coding** that I experienced while developing my first iOS app.

## What is Vibe Coding?

Simply put, it's **a way to build apps together with AI**!

Traditionally, developers had to write all the code, design, and debug everything themselves, right? But with Vibe Coding, **AI creates the code, and I act as a director, saying "this looks good, fix that"**.

### Characteristics of Vibe Coding

1. **Collaboration with AI tools**: Working with AI friends like [Cursor](https://cursor.com/downloads), [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code), [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/)
2. **Build fast and improve**: Don't make perfect plans, just build quickly first!
3. **Code review is essential**: Look at AI-generated code and check "is this right?" and request modifications
4. **Keep iterating**: Find problems ‚Üí Ask AI to fix them ‚Üí Check again ‚Üí Repeat!

## How has the development approach changed?

AI tools have become so good these days that the way we develop has completely changed!

### Old way (Traditional Development)
- **Plan ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Code ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy**
- Developers had to do everything themselves
- Start development after perfect design
- Predictable but takes a long time

### Current way (Vibe Coding)
- **Idea ‚Üí Collaborate with AI ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Improve ‚Üí Repeat**
- AI codes, I review and give feedback
- Build quickly first and improve gradually
- Flexible and fast, but lots of unexpected things happen üòÖ

## Vibe Coding: Pros and Cons

### üëç Good points
- **Really fast**: Development speed changes dramatically thanks to AI
- **Learn new things**: Looking at AI-generated code, "Oh, there's this method too!"
- **Focus on creation**: Can focus more on "what app should I make?" rather than coding
- **Lower barrier to entry**: You can make apps even if you're not good at coding!

### üëé Disappointing points
- **Must review everything**: Need to check 100% of AI-generated code
- **Become anxious without AI**: Gradually become dependent on AI
- **Debugging is difficult**: When problems occur, spend a long time wondering "why doesn't this work?"
- **Fewer opportunities to code directly**: Since you don't write by hand, it feels like skills don't improve?

## My actual experience making an app with Vibe Coding

I made a tip calculator app called TipSmart with Vibe Coding!

### How did I start?
- **Idea**: "Should I make a tip calculator app?"
- **Design with AI**: Designed MVVM architecture together with [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code)
- **Quick code generation**: Generated SwiftUI code quickly with [Cursor](https://cursor.com/downloads)
- **Continuous improvement**: Looked at the created code and repeated feedback like "fix this like this"

### Problems I actually encountered üòÖ
- **AdMob ads infinite loading**: The code AI created was somehow strange
- **Core Data synchronization problem**: Bug where UI didn't update
- **When registering on App Store**: The app description AI created was too insufficient

Still, by solving these problems one by one, I finally **successfully launched on the App Store**!

## When is it good to use Vibe Coding?

### ‚úÖ Recommended in these cases
- **Prototyping**: When you want to quickly check "is this idea good?"
- **Personal projects**: When you want to make something by yourself
- **Simple apps**: When making apps with not complex features
- **AI tool practice**: When you want to try new AI tools

### ‚ùå Be careful in these cases
- **Large projects**: When complex systems are needed
- **Performance-critical apps**: When speed or optimization is key
- **Security-critical apps**: Apps handling sensitive information
- **Team projects**: When multiple people develop together (code styles might not match)

## In conclusion

Vibe Coding isn't perfect. But **being able to develop quickly and flexibly is a big advantage**! I think it's a really good method especially for individual developers or those thinking "should I try making an app?"

**Next article preview**: I'll compare in detail the AI tools I actually used ([Cursor](https://cursor.com/downloads), [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code), [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/)). I'll share honest reviews about what characteristics each has and which was better!

## üì± Try TipSmart!

This is the first app I made with Vibe Coding. Please experience what an app made with AI is like and give me feedback!
