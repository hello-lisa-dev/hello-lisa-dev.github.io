Hello, I'm LISA! üôÇ

Today I want to talk about **Vibe Coding** that I experienced while developing my first iOS app.

## What is Vibe Coding?

Simply put, it's **a way of building apps together with AI**!

Traditionally, developers would write all the code themselves, design everything, and debug it all, right? But with Vibe Coding, **AI creates the code, and I act as a director saying "this looks good, fix that"**.

This is a completely different approach from traditional development methods. Instead of me writing code line by line, I collaborate with AI to create applications.

## How is it Different from Traditional Development?

### Traditional Development
- Developer writes all code directly
- Spends a lot of time on syntax and implementation details
- Debugging and problem-solving done manually
- Learning curve is steep for new technologies

### Vibe Coding
- AI generates code based on natural language descriptions
- Focus on logic and user experience rather than syntax
- AI helps with debugging and suggests solutions
- Faster prototyping and iteration cycles

## My Experience with Vibe Coding

When I developed TipSmart (my tip calculator app), I used this approach extensively. Instead of learning Swift syntax from scratch, I could describe what I wanted in plain language, and the AI would generate the appropriate code.

This allowed me to focus on:
- User experience design
- App functionality and features
- Business logic
- Testing and refinement

Rather than getting bogged down in:
- Syntax details
- Framework documentation
- Boilerplate code
- Common implementation patterns

## The Benefits I Discovered

1. **Faster Development**: What might have taken weeks to learn and implement took days
2. **Better Focus**: I could concentrate on what the app should do rather than how to code it
3. **Learning Opportunity**: Seeing AI-generated code helped me understand patterns and best practices
4. **Iteration Speed**: Making changes and trying new features became much faster

## Is Vibe Coding Right for Everyone?

This approach works particularly well for:
- Rapid prototyping
- Learning new technologies
- Solo developers or small teams
- Projects where speed to market is important

However, it's important to:
- Understand the generated code
- Test thoroughly
- Have some programming fundamentals
- Know when to override AI suggestions

## Conclusion

Vibe Coding isn't about replacing traditional programming skills‚Äîit's about augmenting them. It's a new way to collaborate with AI tools to build better software faster.

In my next posts, I'll dive deeper into the specific AI tools I used and share more detailed experiences from my app development journey.

What do you think about this approach? Have you tried collaborating with AI in your development work?
