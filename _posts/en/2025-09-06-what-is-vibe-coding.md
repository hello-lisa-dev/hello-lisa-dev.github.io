Hey there, I'm LISA! üôÇ

Today I want to share my experience with **Vibe Coding** that I discovered while developing my first iOS app.

## What's Vibe Coding anyway?

Simply put, it's **working with AI to build apps together**!

You know how traditionally, developers had to write all the code, design everything, and debug stuff themselves? Well, Vibe Coding is different - **AI creates the code, and I'm more like a supervisor going "this looks good, hey can you fix that part?"**

### Characteristics of Vibe Coding

1. **Working with AI buddies**: Collaborating with AI tools like [Cursor](https://cursor.com/downloads), [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code), [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/)
2. **Build fast, improve later**: Skip the perfect planning - just get something working first!
3. **Always review the code**: Check what AI made and be like "hmm, is this right?" then ask for fixes
4. **Keep going back and forth**: Spot issues ‚Üí Ask AI to fix ‚Üí Check again ‚Üí Repeat the cycle!

## How has development changed?

AI tools got so crazy good that development is totally different now!

### The old way (Traditional Development)
- **Plan ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Code ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy**
- Developers had to do literally everything
- You'd design everything perfectly before starting
- Super predictable but took forever

### The new way (Vibe Coding)
- **Idea ‚Üí Work with AI ‚Üí Check it out ‚Üí Make it better ‚Üí Repeat**
- AI does the coding, I give feedback and direction
- Build something quick first, then make it awesome step by step
- Flexible and fast, but lots of unexpected things happen üòÖ

## Vibe Coding: Pros and Cons

### üëç Good points
- **Really fast**: Development speed changes dramatically thanks to AI
- **Learn new things**: Looking at AI-generated code, "Oh, there's this method too!"
- **Focus on creation**: Can focus more on "what app should I make?" rather than coding
- **Lower barrier to entry**: You can make apps even if you're not good at coding!

### üëé Disappointing points
- **Must review everything**: Need to check 100% of AI-generated code
- **Become anxious without AI**: Gradually become dependent on AI
- **Debugging is difficult**: When problems occur, spend a long time wondering "why doesn't this work?"
- **Fewer opportunities to code directly**: Since you don't write by hand, it feels like skills don't improve?

## My actual experience making an app with Vibe Coding

I made a tip calculator app called TipSmart with Vibe Coding!

### How did I start?
- **Idea**: "Should I make a tip calculator app?"
- **Design with AI**: Designed MVVM architecture together with [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code)
- **Quick code generation**: Generated SwiftUI code quickly with [Cursor](https://cursor.com/downloads)
- **Continuous improvement**: Looked at the created code and repeated feedback like "fix this like this"

### Problems I actually encountered üòÖ
- **AdMob ads infinite loading**: The code AI created was somehow strange
- **Core Data synchronization problem**: Bug where UI didn't update
- **When registering on App Store**: The app description AI created was too insufficient

Still, by solving these problems one by one, I finally **successfully launched on the App Store**!

## When is it good to use Vibe Coding?

### ‚úÖ Recommended in these cases
- **Prototyping**: When you want to quickly check "is this idea good?"
- **Personal projects**: When you want to make something by yourself
- **Simple apps**: When making apps with not complex features
- **AI tool practice**: When you want to try new AI tools

### ‚ùå Be careful in these cases
- **Large projects**: When complex systems are needed
- **Performance-critical apps**: When speed or optimization is key
- **Security-critical apps**: Apps handling sensitive information
- **Team projects**: When multiple people develop together (code styles might not match)

## In conclusion

Vibe Coding isn't perfect. But **being able to develop quickly and flexibly is a big advantage**! I think it's a really good method especially for individual developers or those thinking "should I try making an app?"

**Next article preview**: I'll compare in detail the AI tools I actually used ([Cursor](https://cursor.com/downloads), [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code), [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/)). I'll share honest reviews about what characteristics each has and which was better!

## üì± Try TipSmart!

This is the first app I made with Vibe Coding. Please experience what an app made with AI is like and give me feedback!
