Hey there, I'm LISA! ðŸ™‚

Today I want to share the story of discovering **Task Master**, a tool that became a real turning point in my AI development journey. Looking back, I don't think I could have properly built TipSmart without this tool.

## AI Development Back Then - Something Was Missing

This was around May 2025. Back then, **Cursor** was pretty much all I knew for AI development tools. I had just discovered Claude Code and was having some exciting experiences with it.

But there was a problem.

### **Inconsistent Development**
When developing with Cursor or Claude Code:
- I ended up **focusing only on solving immediate problems**
- I **couldn't see the big picture**
- Code styles were all over the place, architecture lacked consistency...

For example, if I said "build a login feature," it would build one, but when I later said "build a signup feature too," it would create it in a completely different style. Each piece worked individually, but when put together, it felt... awkward?

### **Limitations Grew with Project Scale**
Simple features one by one were fine, but when I tried to work on **complex, large projects**, the limitations became obvious.

- "What should I do next?"
- "Oh, I forgot about this part"  
- "The style changed from what I made before?"

I felt like I needed **systematic management**.

## Accidental Discovery - Task Master

While searching the internet, I accidentally discovered **Task Master**.

When I first saw the GitHub page, my honest feeling was... "Oh, this looks pretty good?" Back then it didn't have **9.7k stars** like now - it was really early days.

### **First Impression: "This is what I was looking for!"**

When I read the README:
- **AI-powered task management system**
- **Parses PRD (Product Requirements Document) to generate tasks**
- **Integrates with Cursor, VS Code, etc.**

"Huh? This seems like it could solve the problems I've been having?"

What particularly interested me was **automatically converting PRD to tasks**. Until then, I'd been making impromptu requests like "do this, do that," but this would let me plan ahead and proceed systematically.

## Reasons I Hesitated to Adopt

But I didn't start right away. There were some obstacles.

### **1. Lack of PRD Writing Experience**
I'd heard of **requirements management** as a concept, but I'd never actually **written a PRD myself**.

"I know what a PRD is, but how do I actually write one?"
"I know clearly what I want to make, but how do I organize it into a document?"

It felt overwhelming.

### **2. Claude API Cost Concerns**
This was an even bigger obstacle. Task Master required a **Claude API key**.

Even though I was already subscribing to **Claude Pro**, using **pay-per-use pricing** felt different.

"I don't know how much it'll cost..."
"I'm already paying for Pro subscription, and now API too?"
"What if I get a huge bill?"

Looking back now, this was **completely unnecessary worry**. ðŸ˜…

## Taking the Leap

But curiosity won out. "Let's just try it!"

I got an API key and tested it with a few simple projects. Then I realized.

### **The Cost Was Really Cheap**
**I charged $5 and I'm still using it**. Even after working on multiple projects. It really was just **the cost of a couple cups of coffee**.

"Why did I worry so much?" I thought.

### **PRD Writing Wasn't That Hard Either**
This part was also thanks to **AI tools**. Writing PRDs with Claude's help was easier than I thought.

"If I'm clear about what I want to make, AI can help with PRD writing!"

## First Usage Experience - "This Really Works!"

From May to July, I tested Task Master with **various small projects**.

### **Amazing Detail**
Even with simple requirements, it created **really detailed tasks**.

"Wow, it even thought of this?"
"These steps are similar to actual development!"

Since it generated **tasks similar to actual development processes**, I was confident that "this could systematically manage big projects too."

### **Consistent Workflow**
What I liked most was **consistency**.

- With clearly defined tasks
- I could ask Claude Code to "just do this task"
- Overall architecture and style stayed consistent

"This is it! This is the approach I was looking for!"

## And Then... TipSmart

After various tests, when I was confident that **"this tool is reliable"**, I started developing TipSmart in July.

Since it was now a **proven tool**, I used Task Master as my main tool without hesitation.

The result was... as you know, **successful App Store launch**! ðŸŽ‰

## Looking Back Now...

Looking at Task Master's GitHub now, it has grown to **9.7k stars, 1k forks**. When I discovered it in May, I didn't know it would become this popular...

It feels like **I discovered a good tool early**. ðŸ˜Š

### **Why Task Master is Needed**
From my experience, it seems really useful for these people:

âœ… **People using AI dev tools but struggling with consistency**
âœ… **Those wanting to systematically manage large projects**  
âœ… **People who want to develop while seeing the "big picture"**
âœ… **Those wanting systematic development processes based on PRDs**
