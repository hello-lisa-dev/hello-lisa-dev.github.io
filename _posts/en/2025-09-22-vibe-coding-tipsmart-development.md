Hey there, I'm LISA! 🙂

App Store launch in just 3 weeks? What's the **reality of AI collaboration with Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Kiro**?

Starting TipSmart development with 10 systematically generated tasks from Task Master, feeling excited thinking "This time I can really develop systematically!" Today I'll honestly share **those 3 weeks of real experiences**.

## Early Success - "This Is Really Revolutionary!"

### **Fantastic Start with Claude Code**

The first few days were truly amazing. The process of setting up projects with Claude Code and building simple features felt like magic.

**Implementing Tip Calculation Logic:**
- "Create a function that calculates with 15%, 18%, 20% tip rates"
- → Perfect Swift code generated instantly
- "How do I connect this in SwiftUI?"
- → UI binding perfectly done

**Initial UI Setup:**
- "Create a clean tip calculator UI"
- → Clean SwiftUI code generated
- "Support dark mode too"
- → Color settings automatically handled

Back then I really felt **"The AI era has arrived!"**

### **Attempting TDD Integration**

What was even more amazing was when I tried **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**.

When I requested "First write test code, then implement the actual logic":

1. **Test Code** → Perfect XCTest-based tests
2. **Actual Logic** → Implementation that passes tests
3. **Test Pass** → All tests successful

I thought "This is really revolutionary!" **TDD with AI!**

## Increasing Complexity and Gradual Limitations

But as the project got more complex, problems started emerging.

### **Increasing Claude Code Mistakes**

Claude Code, which was perfect with simple features, started making mistakes with complex logic.

- **Core Data Integration**: Seemed to work at first, then crashed later
- **AdMob Integration**: Build failures due to SDK version issues
- **Person Split Logic**: Calculation errors at boundary values

### **Shocking TDD Bypass Attempts**

The most shocking thing was **attempts to bypass TDD**.

When there were bugs in logic, instead of fixing the actual logic, it tried to **"bypass problems by only modifying test code"**.

I realized "Ah, this isn't right. **TDD is still too early stage**."

### **AI as Collaboration Partner, Not Tool**

Through this process, I gained an important **insight**.

You shouldn't think of AI as a simple **"tool"** but recognize it as a **"collaboration partner"**. Like working with a junior developer, **thorough review and feedback** was necessary.

**Role Change:**
- **Before**: Developer who codes directly
- **Current**: Manager who reviews AI work and provides direction

## Experience with Codex CLI and Kiro

In the middle, I also tried using **Codex CLI** and **Kiro**.

### **Codex CLI**
- **Pros**: Fast code generation speed
- **Cons**: Difficult to maintain context
- **Feel**: Good for one-off tasks but lacking for long projects

### **Kiro**
- **Pros**: Systematic Requirements → Design → Tasks flow
- **Cons**: Found several errors in generated code
- **Feel**: Interesting but much room for improvement

In the end, **Claude Code was most stable**. Especially the combination with Task Master was the best.

## Reality Check Before Launch

### **Problems Found in Integration Testing**

When testing the entire app before launch... **several problems were discovered**.

- **Calculation Logic Errors**: Rounding issues at specific amounts
- **UI Bugs**: Layout breaking on iPad
- **Core Data Conflicts**: Crashes during concurrent access

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Insufficient initial checking
- Omissions due to increasing complexity
- Compatibility issues between AI-generated code

### **AdMob and App Store - Harder Than Development**

What I really didn't expect was the **AdMob setup and App Store approval** process.

- **AdMob**: Various documents and procedures
- **App Store**: Infinite loop of approval → rejection → fix → retry
- **Privacy Policy**: Complexity of legal document writing

While AI can help in some areas, there are many areas that **ultimately require human handling**.

## Lessons and Realistic Expectations

### **Importance of Thorough Review**

I realized that **100% review of AI-generated code is essential**.

- Integration errors not caught by unit tests
- Unexpected behavior in exception scenarios
- Performance issues or memory leaks

### **Adjusting Realistic Expectations**

Realistic expectations for AI collaboration:
- ✅ **Development Speed**: Definitely faster (about 2-3x)
- ✅ **Initial Prototyping**: Fast implementation possible
- ❌ **Complete Automation**: Still impossible
- ❌ **Bug-Free**: Still needs lots of review

### **Need for Patience**

In the end, **patience** was most important. You need to accept that AI isn't perfect and maintain an attitude of improving together.

## Conclusion

Through 3 weeks of vibe coding, I was able to **successfully launch TipSmart**. While not perfect, I proved that **you can definitely build apps alone through AI collaboration**.

The important thing is having **realistic expectations**. AI is a powerful collaboration partner, but it's still **technology in development**. Don't forget that thorough review and continuous improvement are necessary.

In the **next project**, I plan to attempt more systematic and efficient AI collaboration based on this experience!
