Hey there, LISA here! üôÇ

In my last post I talked about [what Vibe Coding is]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url en/2025-09-06-what-is-vibe-coding %}), and today I want to share **honest reviews of the AI development tools I actually used**.

## Why did I only use one tool?

When developing TipSmart, I actually had lots of options. There was Cursor, Gemini CLI... but **I ended up using only Claude Code**. 

Let me tell you why, and how I feel about it looking back!

## How did I actually use them?

### üéØ **Claude Code** - Almost all development
I did **over 90% of TipSmart development with Claude Code**.
- **Code quality**: About 70-80% was satisfactory
- **Feature**: It was impressive how it broke down complex tasks step by step

### ‚ùå **Cursor** - Didn't use it at all
I actually tried Cursor since it was famous...
- **Why I didn't use it**: Claude Code felt more systematic
- **Difference**: Cursor is like "do this" ‚Üí immediate processing, while Claude Code approaches like "to do this, we need steps A, B, C"

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Gemini CLI** - Tried a few times then gave up
I tried it since it's Google's...
- **Honest review**: It was a bit disappointing back then (might be much better now!)
- **Why I gave up**: Felt less consistent compared to Claude Code

### ‚ùì **Codex CLI** - Didn't know about it then
I didn't even know this existed when developing TipSmart üòÖ
- **Currently**: I'm using it more than Claude Code in new app development these days!
- **Review coming later**: I'll share detailed thoughts in a separate post

## Why did I go all-in on Claude Code?

### 1. **Perfect combo with Task Master**
This was really good!
- **Extract tasks based on PRD** ‚Üí Task Master does this
- **Throw them one by one to Claude Code** ‚Üí Manages dependencies automatically
- **Not "build an app" but "do just this feature"** ‚Üí Much cleaner results

### 2. **Predictable code quality**
Claude Code is somewhat predictable.
- **Simple features**: Nearly perfect, could use right away
- **Complex features**: About 70-80%? Needed some refactoring but
- **At least it didn't crash** (this is important!)

### 3. **Step-by-step approach**
This seems to be Claude Code's unique feature.
- When it gets complex requests: **"To do this, we need to divide it into steps 1, 2, 3"**
- Proceeds while confirming each step
- If problems occur, you only need to fix that step, making management easy

## But there were problems too... üòÖ

### üö® **Real problems I encountered**

#### 1. **"Where is this function?"**
This was an error I often saw when building AI-generated code.
- Build errors saying **using functions that don't exist**
- Probably functions that exist in AI training data but not in actual iOS SDK?
- Fortunately, it was caught during build so not a big problem

#### 2. **Over time, the architecture became...**
Initially it followed the rules I wrote in CLAUDE.md well.
- **Gradually over time, it ignored my style and coded however it wanted** üòÇ
- Later I realized "Huh? This isn't the structure I wanted?"
- Eventually had to refactor

#### 3. **"Said it's done but there's more work..."**
When it said one task was finished:
- **"Oh, but we need to do this too"** while creating additional work
- Way more follow-up tasks than expected
- **Felt like finishing one created two more**

### üìä **Realistic code quality**
Being honest:
- **About 70-80% satisfactory** (not perfect but usable)
- **More mistakes as complexity increased**
- **Must do 100% code review** (this is obvious though)

## Why didn't I use other tools?

### **Why Cursor wasn't great (back then)**
When I tried Cursor during TipSmart development...
- **"Do this" ‚Üí "Yes, done"** kind of feeling?
- Claude Code is like **"To do this, we need these steps"** step by step
- Back then Claude Code felt more systematic
- **Now it's different**: These days I'm trying various things with Cursor in new app development!

### **Gemini CLI was... hmm...**
Had expectations since it's Google's
- **Back then it was disappointing** (don't know how it is now)
- Updates were too fast, felt somewhat unstable?
- Felt less consistent compared to Claude Code

## Why Claude Code's divide-and-conquer strategy was good

### **Difference from other tools**
Simply put:
- **Other tools**: "Implement this feature" ‚Üí "Yes, all done!"
- **Claude Code**: "To implement this feature... need to do A first, then B, then C. Sound good?"

### **Task Master + Claude Code combo**
This combination was really good:

1. **Task Master looks at PRD** ‚Üí Creates roughly 10 high-level tasks
2. **Each high-level task gets subdivided** ‚Üí Total of 50-60 detailed tasks
3. **Throw them one by one to Claude Code** ‚Üí Each gets processed step by step

In the end, it was like **developing the entire app by dividing it into hundreds of small steps**. Complex apps were easy to manage, and if problems occurred, you only needed to fix that step.

## In conclusion...

Being honest, **AI development tools aren't perfect**. About 70-80%? But if used properly, they're really helpful.

I liked the **Claude Code + Task Master combination** because it was systematic and predictable.

**Oh, and one more thing!** This is from TipSmart development 2-3 months ago. Things are very different now:

- **Cursor**: Much updated, so I'm trying various things with it in new apps these days
- **Codex CLI**: I've been using it a lot recently, honestly using it more than Claude Code
- **Detailed reviews of each tool**: I'll share these in separate posts!

Still, I shared honest reviews based on TipSmart development experience.

**Next post preview**: How I used Task Master to divide PRD into 50-60 tasks and managed them, I'll share that entire process in detail. That's the real core of Vibe Coding!

And... **Want to try the first app I made this way, TipSmart?** It's a tip calculator and turned out pretty well! Would really appreciate your feedback too üòä

## üì± Download TipSmart

This is my first iOS app made with Claude Code. Experience the result of AI-collaborative development firsthand!
