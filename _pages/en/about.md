# Hello, I'm LISA! 👋

**Junior developer and passionate experimenter of Vibe Coding**

## 🎯 Who am I?

I'm a junior developer. This is my first time with iOS development, and I just started using Swift. However, I have a deep interest in **new development approaches through collaboration with AI tools**.

### As a Developer
- **Experience**: Junior developer (first time with iOS development)
- **Interests**: AI collaborative development, app monetization, user experience
- **Development Philosophy**: "Let's just try it! It's okay to fail, that's what Vibe Coding is all about"

## 🚀 What is Vibe Coding?

Vibe Coding is the development approach I pursue.

**Traditional Development**: Developers write all code directly
**Vibe Coding**: AI generates code, and I review and supervise the results

### Characteristics of Vibe Coding
- **Collaboration with AI**: Working with Cursor, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, etc.
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Quick start and improvement rather than perfect planning
- **Review and Supervision**: Evaluate AI-generated code quality and request modifications
- **Iterative Improvement**: Find problems → Request AI improvements → Review → Repeat

## 📱 First iOS App Development Experience

[TipSmart](https://apps.apple.com/app/tipsmart-tip-calculator/id6749946714) is my first iOS app developed with Vibe Coding.

### Development Process
- **Idea**: "Let's make a tip calculator app"
- **AI Collaboration**: Designed MVVM architecture with Claude Code
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Generated SwiftUI code with Cursor
- **Review and Improvement**: Reviewed generated code and requested problem fixes

### Real Experiences
- Infinite loading problem in AI-generated AdMob integration code
- UI update issues in Core Data synchronization code
- Insufficient app information generated by AI during App Store submission

However, by solving these problems one by one, I was eventually able to successfully launch my first iOS app.

## 🎯 What I Pursue

### Goals
- **Small monetization through apps**: Income through AdMob ads and subscription features
- **Continuous learning**: Improving development skills through collaboration with AI tools
- **Community building**: Communication with developers who share similar interests

### Values
- **Honesty**: Sharing failures and trial-and-error without hiding them
- **Realism**: Actual experiences and results without exaggeration
- **Growth**: Starting even if not perfect and improving along the way
- **Sharing**: A community that grows together through shared experiences
