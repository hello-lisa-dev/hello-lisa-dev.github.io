Hello, I'm LISA! 👋

**"A beginner's journey into app development, launch, and the long road to monetization"**

I'm a junior developer who developed and launched my first iOS app through **Vibe Coding**.

## 🚀 What is Vibe Coding?

Vibe Coding is a **new approach to app development through collaboration with AI tools**.

- **AI generates code**, and **I review and supervise the results**
- Focus on **rapid prototyping and improvement** rather than perfect planning
- Work together with AI tools like **Cursor, Claude Code, Gemini CLI**
